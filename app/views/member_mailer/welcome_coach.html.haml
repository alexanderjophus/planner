    The success of our workshops depends on coaches attending.
  If you accept an invitation but can't make it any more, please let us know
  %strong
    as soon as possible
  so we can allocate your place to someone on the waiting list. If you take a place
  on the waiting list, please keep that evening free and check your emails frequently.
  You will be notified at least three hours before the event if you receive a place.

  or looking for help with their own project. Don't worry if you're not an expert on
  the topics - your role is not about having all the answers! Guiding a student through
  solving their own problem is more useful in the long run. There are more
